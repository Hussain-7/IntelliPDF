Great! The project summary is now comprehensive and meets the documentation standards. Here's the final summary of the IntelliPDF project:

# Project Documentation

## 1. Overview
### Project Name
ChatPDF - AI-Powered PDF Document Analysis

### Purpose
ChatPDF is a full-stack application that allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with them through a chat interface. The application uses AI technologies to analyze PDF content and respond intelligently to user queries about the document. It solves the problem of quickly extracting information from lengthy documents by enabling conversational interaction with PDF content. Target users include researchers, students, and professionals who need to efficiently extract insights from PDF documents without reading them in full. The application has a specific focus on W2 tax forms, providing specialized analysis for this document type.

### Key Features
- PDF document upload and management
- AI-powered document analysis
- Interactive chat interface for querying document content
- User authentication and dashboard
- Document viewing with advanced PDF rendering capabilities
- Real-time message processing with streaming responses
- W2 tax form specialized analysis
- Admin interface for system management

## 2. Architecture Overview
### Type of Application
Full-stack web application

### Data Flow
1. Users upload PDF documents through the UI
2. Documents are stored and processed using vector embeddings
3. User queries are sent through the chat interface
4. The backend processes queries against the document's vector DB
5. The system retrieves relevant document sections using semantic search
6. AI generates relevant responses based on document content and chat history
7. Responses are streamed back to the frontend in real-time

## 3. Technology Stack
